# Accounting and Multi-tenancy

## Content

### ‚ùì What types of entities can be considered 'tenants' when implementing Namespace-based multi-tenancy in Kubernetes?
Tenant is a loose term that can refer to: individual applications, different teams or departments, and even external customers. How you implement Namespaces and what you consider as tenants is up to you, but it's most common to use Namespaces to divide clusters for use by tenants within the same organization.
