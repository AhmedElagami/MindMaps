# Headless Service Requirement

## Content

### ‚ùì What is the role of the serviceName field in a StatefulSet, how does the 'dullahan' headless Service interact with the StatefulSet's DNS configuration, and what components are typically defined in the Pod template section?
The `serviceName` field designates the governing Service for the StatefulSet. In this case, it points to the "dullahan" headless Service that was created in the previous step. This governing Service creates the DNS SRV records for the StatefulSet replicas and is responsible for managing the StatefulSet's DNS subdomain. We call it the governing Service because it's in charge of the StatefulSet's DNS subdomain.

The Pod template section of a StatefulSet specification typically defines components such as which container image to use, which ports to expose, volume mounts, and other container-specific configurations. In this example, the template defines an nginx container with port 80 exposed, volume mounts for persistent storage, and a termination grace period of 10 seconds.
