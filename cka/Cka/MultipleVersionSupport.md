# Multiple Version Support

## Content

### ❓ What is the primary purpose of the kubectl api-versions command and what specific information can it reveal about a cluster, and what does it indicate when an API group has multiple versions enabled simultaneously?
The kubectl api-versions command shows which API versions your cluster supports. It doesn't list which resources belong to which APIs, but it's good for finding out whether your cluster has things like alpha APIs enabled.

When an API group has multiple versions enabled simultaneously, such as beta and stable, or v1 and v2, it indicates that the cluster supports multiple API versions for that group. This allows for backward compatibility and gradual migration between API versions, as different resources or operations might be available in different versions of the same API group.

### ❓ What does the output of the 'kubectl api-versions' command reveal about the structure of API groups and their available versions, and what does this indicate about Kubernetes' versioning strategy and backward compatibility?
The 'kubectl api-versions' command output reveals that API groups in Kubernetes can have multiple versions enabled simultaneously, such as beta and stable versions, or v1 and v2 versions. This demonstrates Kubernetes' versioning strategy that supports backward compatibility by allowing multiple API versions to coexist. For example, the output shows both 'autoscaling/v1' and 'autoscaling/v2' are available, indicating that newer versions can be introduced while maintaining support for older versions to ensure compatibility with existing applications.

```bash
$ kubectl api-versions
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
apps/v1
<Snip>
autoscaling/v1
autoscaling/v2
v1
```
