### ❓ Why is the 'running and ready' state important for StatefulSet Pod creation and scaling operations?
The "running and ready" state is critically important for StatefulSet Pod creation and scaling operations because it ensures that each Pod is fully operational before the next one starts. 

"Running and ready" is a term that indicates all containers in a Pod are running and the Pod is ready to service requests. The StatefulSet controller uses this state to:

1. **Ensure proper startup sequence**: The controller waits for each Pod to be running and ready before starting the next Pod in the sequence (e.g., waits for tkb-sts-0 to be ready before starting tkb-sts-1).

2. **Govern scaling operations**: When scaling up (e.g., from 3 to 5 replicas), the controller starts a new Pod called tkb-sts-3 and waits for it to be running and ready before creating tkb-sts-4.

3. **Maintain application stability**: This prevents race conditions and ensures that applications with dependencies (like database clusters or distributed systems) can properly initialize and establish connections before additional replicas join.

4. **Support stateful application requirements**: Many stateful applications require specific startup sequences or leader election processes that depend on previous replicas being fully operational.

This behavior is architecturally different from Deployments, which use the ReplicaSet controller and can start all Pods simultaneously.

### ❓ What is the purpose of setting a termination grace period for StatefulSet Pods, and what minimum duration is commonly recommended?
For example, it's common to set this to at least 10 seconds to give applications time to flush any buffers and safely commit writes that are still in flight.
