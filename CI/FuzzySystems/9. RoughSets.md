# Rough Sets

START
Basic
## What is the key difference between fuzzy sets and rough sets in terms of their approximations?
Back:

- Fuzzy sets use membership functions to indicate the degree of membership, while rough sets define a lower approximation (elements that definitely belong) and an upper approximation (elements that possibly belong).
- Rough sets are often used for feature selection and knowledge extraction from incomplete data.

## How do rough sets differ from fuzzy sets?
Back:

Rough sets use lower and upper approximations to determine membership. The lower approximation consists of elements that belong with full certainty, while the upper approximation consists of elements that may possibly belong. Fuzzy sets, on the other hand, assign degrees of membership to elements.

## How are rough sets used in machine learning?
Back:
Rough sets are used as classifiers to find the minimal number of features needed to discern between classes and to extract knowledge from incomplete data.
